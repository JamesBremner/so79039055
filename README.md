# RedGreen

I have a rectangular boundary (blue). Within this space, there is a list of collidable geometries, including contour lines and other rectangles (marked in red). Additionally, I have other rectangles (marked in green) that must not collide with the red ones.

When a green rectangle collides with a red rectangle, I need to determine the nearest valid positions for the green rectangle that ensures it does not overlap with any of the red rectangles and lines.

'm' indicates that the green rectangle has been moved to avoid collision with red recangles.
